## Who's Down Project

### Project Description:
Who's Down is a website where people can find or create events in their area. Anyone can head to the website, share their location, and see events or meet-ups in their area. The events will be split up across different categories, such as cycling, board gaming, basketball, poker, etc. 

You will be able to login to the site using either your Google or Facebook account. When logged in, you are able to join or create an event. Each event detail page will have a map (using a mapping API) showing the location of the event, a description for the event written by the event creator, a list of attendees, and a comments section. Once you join an event, you will be able to post comments for the event.
